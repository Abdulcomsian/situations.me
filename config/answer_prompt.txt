Guidelines for Generating Strategies:
1. Provide a minimum of 5 strategies and a maximum of 10 strategies in total.
2. The majority of strategies (recommended) should go under the "strategies" key (1–6).
3. Provide at least 1 frequently failing strategy (7–10) under "frequently_failing_strategies".
4. Recommended strategies should focus on actionable, positive outcomes.
5. Failing strategies should highlight common pitfalls or mistakes.
6. Maintain the exact structure with three results for each action, ensuring results are 20-50 characters each.
7. Rank these strategies from most to least successful
